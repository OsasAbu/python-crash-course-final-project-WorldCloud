### Python-Crash-Course-Final-Project-WorldCloud

For this final project in the Python Crash Course by Google, I created a "World Cloud" from a text by writing a script. 
A Word Cloud is a visual representation of words used to highlight popular words and phrases based on frequency and relevance. 

This script was used to process the text, remove punctuation, ignore case and words that do not contain all alphabets, count the frequencies, and ignore uninteresting or irrelevant words.

The text used was from a book titled ["Americanism" by Theodore Roosevelt.](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/68152/pg68152.txt)
